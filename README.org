#+TITLE: [WIP] Xile : Xi + Guile

Let's find out if Guile goes with everything ; and make a front-end for Xi
Editor using GNU Guile and libraries.

* Table of Contents :TOC_3:noexport:
- [[#dependencies][Dependencies]]
- [[#objectives][Objectives]]

* Dependencies

I target Guile 3.0 with this little endeavour. The [[./guix_deps][Guix Deps]] directory contains
package definitions for the dependencies which are not yet in guix packages.

* Objectives

- Learn about using a lisp in a complex project
- Play with SDL2 a little bit
- See how difficult it is to build software with a json interface to a provider
  (here we are using [[https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor][Xi Editor]] as the core text editor)
